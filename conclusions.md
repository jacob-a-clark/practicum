#Conclusions

The resutls of the quantitative analysis indicate that Van Buren Countyis of particular high risk of obesity-related outcomes, as compared to other counties in Iowa. Howard County presents an opposite result based on the rankings.  The interviews indicated that obesity was a perceived major issue in both counties, and the impacts of the health outcome were experienced by their public health workers.  Juxtaposing the two counties, however, presents some potential areas of need that may be acting as contributing or protective factors of obesity and its health outcomes.

Nonetheless, actionable recommendations and interventions would be premature. This project merely acts as a first pass at the issue, and requires further development and coinciding investigations to arrive at any reasonable conclusions.

Ways to further mature this query include:
- Follow-up interviews
- Interviews of other occupations
- Investigate differences in mortality and in-patient data

### Recommendations

The Tracking Portal was found to be rich and accessible source of info.
Better description of data
Provide recommendations of how to use data (for example, this project)

The ranking method used in project can act as supplementary tool for any quantitative analysis using this type of data
