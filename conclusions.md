# Conclusions

The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that Van Buren County is of particular high risk of obesity-related outcomes, as compared to other counties in Iowa. Howard County presents an opposite result based on the rankings.  The interviews indicated that obesity was a perceived major issue in both counties, and the impacts of the health outcome were experienced by their public health workers.  Juxtaposing the two counties, however, presents some potential areas of need that may be acting as contributing or protective factors of obesity and its health outcomes.

Nonetheless, actionable recommendations and interventions would be premature. This project merely acts as a first pass at the issue, and requires further development and coinciding investigations to arrive at any reasonable conclusions.

Ways to further mature this query include:
- Follow-up interviews
- Interviews of other occupations
- Investigate differences in mortality and in-patient data

### Recommendations

The tracking portal released by the IDPH was found to be great source of information on huge compendium of health topics.  In addition to the mortality and in-patient data, there is also other types of data like, birth data. There are many ways to filter out and sort data, such as value type (e.g. count, crude, age-adjusted), year, and ICD coding.  For public health officials and people doing research in the field, this is a great tool to look into health issues in Iowa at the state and county level.  More involved research would need to find other sources of information since demographics such as race and sex are not provided, but for everyone else this will provide nearly anything necessary.

Since there are several repositories found in the Tracking Portal, an in-depth explanation of the each would be helpful in deciding which is appropriate.  Additionally, the IDPH could provide vignettes or other ways to expound on how best to use the data, limitations of research using the data, and practices to avoid.

To facilitate better ease of access, a guide to using the Tracking Portal data is also recommended. For instance, a quick video tutorial on how to locate specific information, filter, and download data. 

The scoring system devised in this project may be useful for those wanting to pinpoint counties consistently ranking high among a variety of health aspects.  As the tracking portal provides a plethora of information on many different health issues Iowa, this rank scoring system works nicely with age-adjusted data found therein for county comparisons.  Since it puts weight on only those counties in the top ten of the rate of interest, it ignores all the other eighty-eight counties and thus allows quick identification of potential outliers. This means much of the potential sifting and sorting is significantly reduced and manual identification (i.e. “eye-balling”) is viable and, as in the case of this project, more efficient.
