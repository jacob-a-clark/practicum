Ranking counties across health aspects was used to determine outlier (high and low) counties for qualitative review.  Rather than a naive ranking of all 99 counties, a scoring method was used to focus on those ranked in the top 5 and top 10 highest/lowest rates. To only capture counties that had higher rates,the scoring system for each health aspect gave counties in the top five a value of two, those within the top six to ten a value of one, and everything else a zero.  This means that the sum of scores across all aspects provided each county a total score that described how often it was in the top ten—and particularly in the top five—highest counties with regard to all aspects.  Scores were totaled separately for the mortality and in-patient data.

Between the two types of data, seven counties typically scored higher than all the rest.  Van Buren County in particular appeared to stand out as it was not only one of the highest within mortality data, but also the highest within in-patient data by a noticeably wider margin.  Using the same method as before but reversing the ranks, Howard County was found to be among the lowest consistently in all aspects and across both data.

For the in-patient data, a correlation between some of the heart-related health aspects might have been inflating the numbers (i.e issue of multiple aspects in the same casual pathway for a particular diagnosis).  A weighting system was tested to help remedy this and found no real difference in results.  Several other various iterations, such as scaling the data, were done with similar findings.

Below are the age-adjusted barcharts found in the various health outcome pages, but highlighting the standings of Van Buren (red) and Howard (light blue):
