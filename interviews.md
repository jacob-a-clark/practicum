# Interviews

A key public health official or worker in each county was contacted for aninterview about their experiences with obesity, obesity-related health outcomes, and possible contributing factors within each county. A list of questions was drafted to act as prompts and guides for the conversations. Rather than assume an obesity issue, the questions were crafted as to allow the public health workers to bring up issues on their end and not guide the conversation based on my assumptions.  Also, the number of questions was limited such that the interview would not go beyond half an hour to be respectful of time considerations.

**Van Buren County**: Lindee Thomas, RN, Van Buren County Public Health; Connie Kuennen, Community Health Services

**Howard County**: Cindy Souhrada, RN, Regional Health Services of Howard County

After the interviews, many factors were found to be common to both:
- Rural area
- Low SES
- Aging Population
- Obesity perceived to be a major health issue

Discrepancies where Van Buren was lacking:
- No transportation for medical services, especially for elderly
- Inadequate food sources (e.g. low supply of easily accessible fresh produce)
