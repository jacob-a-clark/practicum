This website presents the work and findings of a practicum completed at The University of Iowa.

Its primary goals were:
- (1) to assess the viability of the Iowa Department of Public Health Tracking Portal by
- (2) analyzing data retrieved from the Tracking Portal related to obesity-related outcomes in order to pinpoint outlier counties for obesity and
- (3) use qualitative methods to follow-up on these counties to further investigate possible factors and supporting evidence for the results of the data
